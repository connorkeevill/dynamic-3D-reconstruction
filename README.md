# 3D Reconstruction of Dynamic Environments Using Egomotion Compensated Optical Flow

## Description
This system is developed as part of my undergraduate dissertation with the University of Bath, in a project which 
presents a 3D reconstruction system capable of handling dynamic environments and outperforming works from the state of 
the art.

This project is heavily adapted from the work of Emanuele Palazzolo, Jens Behley, Philipp Lottes, Philippe Gigu√®re, Cyrill Stachniss'
paper "ReFusion: 3D Reconstruction in Dynamic Environments for RGB-D Cameras Exploiting Residuals", _arXiv_, 2019.
